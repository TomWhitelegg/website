TechSoc has a large and varied range of lighting equipment on offer; from the simple to the complex, we have something for everyone. We have a large stock of generic lanterns, as well as a range of moving lights, LED fixtures and effects. We also have a large stock of control equipment, including lighting desks, dimmers and networking equipment.

## Fixtures

### LED Lights

These are perfect for general washes and highlighting specific elements with the benefit of a full spectrum of colour. Our flagship LED lighting is provided by ETC and consists of 6x [ColorSource Fresnel V](https://www.etcconnect.com/Products/Entertainment-Fixtures/ColorSource-Fresnel-V/Features.aspx) lamps, which feature a zooming ability, and 4x [ColorSource Spot Jr](https://www.etcconnect.com/colorsourcespotjr/). We also own 6x [LumiPAR 12UQPRO](https://www.prolights.it/en/product/LUMIPAR12UQPRO) super-slim LED pars and 2x [StudioCob FC](https://www.prolights.it/en/product/STUDIOCOBFC) lights.

#### Uplighters

One of our most versatile pieces of equipment are our uplighters. They can be used either stand-alone or with our wireless-dmx kit to add ambience to all corners of the venue with ease, with the addition of being battery operated to make adapting to event requirements easier then ever. We own 2 lines of uplighters, [Rapid QB1 RGBA IP Uplighters](https://www.prolight.co.uk/Catalogue/Products/Lighting/Uplighters/LEDJ353XX?selected=LEDJ353) and [LiteWare HO Uplighters](https://designservices.co.uk/files/lighting/GDS%20Liteware%20Manual.pdf).

### Moving Lights

Moving lights are perfect for providing specific spots or general effects and as such are one of our most popular pieces of equipment.

## Control Systems

### Lighting Desks

We own 2 [EOS Nomad Kits](https://www.etcconnect.com/ETCnomad/) which allow easy control of 2 universes of DMX straight from your laptop. This also includes a [cmd_key](https://www.cmd-key.com/online-store/cmd_key-for-EOS-p167495540) which works as a keyboard to provide all the necessary controls you would find on a conventional ETC lighting desk.

### Dimmers

We have different dimmers to suit the size of the event and lighting requirements, with our main packs being 2x [Alphapack 3](https://www.vari-lite.com/global/products/alphapack-3) with 3 channels of dimming each and 2x Regal 6 which provide 6 channels of 2x 15amp sockets apiece. All of these dimmer packs are DMX controllable.
